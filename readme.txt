Programmatically Typed and Coupled Soft Body Multi-scope Particle Modeling

Justin Dierking

I am demonstrating a method of particle based simulation in which the interactions between particles are programmed to produce complex behaviors. The purpose of such complexity is to produce soft body models that can be deformed, torn, and execute phase changes as a result of temperature change. The behavior of a soft body model is controlled by defining a series of particle types and defining relationships between particle types. These relationships use bilinear interpolation to generate coefficients from displacement and temperature to control thermal loss, normal acceleration, static drag, dampening, repulsion, attraction, and heating.
